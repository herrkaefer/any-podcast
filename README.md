# Any Podcast

An AI-powered, configurable podcast platform that aggregates content sources, generates summaries, and produces podcast audio. You can define different sources per topic and build your own podcast flow.

## Philosophy

- Source-configurable, topic-agnostic
- Automation lowers the barrier to content creation
- Everyone should be able to run their own podcast pipeline

## Origin

This project evolved from [hacker-podcast](https://github.com/miantiao-me/hacker-podcast). Thanks to the original author for open-sourcing it.
